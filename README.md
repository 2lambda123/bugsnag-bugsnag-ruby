Bugsnag Notifier for Ruby
=========================

The Bugsnag Notifier for Ruby gives you instant notification of exceptions
thrown from your **Rails**, **Sinatra**, **Rack** or **plain Ruby** app.
Any uncaught exceptions will trigger a notification to be sent to your
Bugsnag project.

[Bugsnag](http://bugsnag.com) captures errors in real-time from your web,
mobile and desktop applications, helping you to understand and resolve them
as fast as possible. [Create a free account](http://bugsnag.com) to start
capturing exceptions from your applications.

How to Install
--------------

1.  Add the `bugsnag` gem to your `Gemfile`

    ```ruby
    gem "bugsnag"
    ```

2.  Install the gem

    ```shell
    bundle install
    ```

3.  Configure the Bugsnag module with your API key.

    In rails apps, put this code to a new file at `config/initializers/bugsnag.rb`

    ```ruby
    Bugsnag.configure do |config|
      config.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    end
    ```

    If you don't configure the api_key, the Bugsnag module will read the `BUGSNAG_API_KEY`
    environment variable.

4.  **Rack/Sinatra apps only**: Activate the Bugsnag Rack middleware

    ```ruby
    use Bugsnag::Rack
    ```


Sending Custom Data With Exceptions
-----------------------------------

It is often useful to send additional meta-data about your app, such as
information about the currently logged in user, along with any
exceptions, to help debug problems.

### Rails Apps

In any rails controller you can define a `before_bugsnag_notify` callback,
which allows you to add this additional data by calling `add_tab` on the
exception notification object.

```ruby
class MyController < ApplicationController
  # Define the filter
  before_bugsnag_notify :add_user_info_to_bugsnag

  # Your controller code here

  private
  def add_user_info_to_bugsnag(notif)
    # Add some app-specific data which will be displayed on a custom
    # "User Info" tab on each error page on bugsnag.com
    notif.add_tab(:user_info, {
      name: current_user.name
    })
  end
end
```

### Other Ruby Apps

In other ruby apps, you can provide lambda functions to execute before any
`Bugsnag.notify` calls as follows. Don't forget to clear the callbacks at the
end of each request or session.

```ruby
# Set a before notify callback
Bugsnag.before_notify_callbacks << lambda {|notif|
  notif.add_tab(:user_info, {
    name: current_user.name
  })
}

# Your app code here

# Clear the callbacks
Bugsnag.before_notify_callbacks.clear
```

### Exceptions with Meta Data

If you include the `Bugsnag::MetaData` module into your own exceptions, you can
associate meta data with a paticular exception.

```ruby
class MyCustomException < Exception
  include Bugsnag::MetaData
end

exception = MyCustomException.new("It broke!")
exception.bugsnag_meta_data = {
  :user_info => {
    name: current_user.name
  }
}

raise exception
```

You can read more about how callbacks work in the
[Bugsnag Middleware](#bugsnag-middleware) documentation below.


Sending Non-Fatal Exceptions
----------------------------

If you would like to send non-fatal exceptions to Bugsnag, you can call
`Bugsnag.notify`:

```ruby
Bugsnag.notify(RuntimeError.new("Something broke"))
```

You can also send additional meta-data with your exception:

```ruby
Bugsnag.notify(RuntimeError.new("Something broke"), {
  :username => "bob-hoskins",
  :registered_user => true
})
```

Rake Integration
----------------

Rake integration is automatically enabled in Rails 3 apps, so providing you load the environment
in your Rake tasks you dont need to do anything to get Rake support. If you choose not to load
your environment, you can manually configure Bugsnag with a `bugsnag.configure` block in the Rakefile.

Bugsnag can automatically notify of all exceptions that happen in your rake tasks. In order
to enable this, you need to `require "bugsnag/rake"` in your Rakefile, like so:

```ruby
require File.expand_path('../config/application', __FILE__)
require 'rake'
require "bugsnag/rake"

Bugsnag.configure do |config|
  config.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
end

YourApp::Application.load_tasks
```

**NOTE**: We also configure Bugsnag in the Rakefile, so the tasks that do not load the full
environment can still notify Bugsnag.

Standard Ruby Scripts
---------------------

If you are running a standard ruby script, you can ensure that all exceptions are sent to Bugsnag by
adding the following code to your app:

```ruby
at_exit do
  if $!
    Bugsnag.notify($!)
  end
end
```

Testing Integration
-------------------

To test that bugsnag is properly configured, you can use the test_exception rake task like this,

```bash
rake bugsnag:test_exception
```

A test exception will be sent to your bugsnag dashboard if everything is configured correctly.

Configuration
-------------

To configure additional Bugsnag settings, use the block syntax and set any
settings you need on the `config` block variable. For example:

```ruby
Bugsnag.configure do |config|
  config.api_key = "your-api-key-here"
  config.use_ssl = true
  config.notify_release_stages = ["production", "development"]
end
```

###api_key

Your Bugsnag API key (required).

```ruby
config.api_key = "your-api-key-here"
```

###release_stage

If you would like to distinguish between errors that happen in different
stages of the application release process (development, production, etc)
you can set the `release_stage` that is reported to Bugsnag.

```ruby
config.release_stage = "development"
```

By default the timeout time is 5 seconds. To increase the timout time of the bugsnag
notify call you can set the `timeout_time` to an integer value.

```ruby
config.timeout_time = 10
```

In rails apps this value is automatically set from `RAILS_ENV`, and in rack
apps it is automatically set to `RACK_ENV`. Otherwise the default is
"production".

###notify_release_stages

By default, we will notify Bugsnag of exceptions that happen in any
`release_stage`. If you would like to change which release stages 
notify Bugsnag of exceptions you can set `notify_release_stages`:

```ruby
config.notify_release_stages = ["production", "development"]
```

###auto_notify

By default, we will automatically notify Bugsnag of any fatal exceptions
in your application. If you want to stop this from happening, you can set
`auto_notify`:

```ruby
config.auto_notify = false
```

###use_ssl

Enforces all communication with bugsnag.com be made via ssl.

```ruby
config.use_ssl = true
```

By default, `use_ssl` is set to false.

###project_root

We mark stacktrace lines as `inProject` if they come from files inside your
`project_root`. In rails apps this value is automatically set to `RAILS_ROOT`,
otherwise you should set it manually:

```ruby
config.project_root = "/var/www/myproject"
```

###app_version

If you want to track which versions of your application each exception
happens in, you can set `app_version`. This is set to `nil` by default.

```ruby
config.app_version = "2.5.1"
```

###params_filters

Sets the strings to filter out from the `params` hashes before sending
them to Bugsnag. Use this if you want to ensure you don't send
sensitive data such as passwords, and credit card numbers to our
servers. Any keys which *contain* these strings will be filtered.

```ruby
config.params_filters << "credit_card_number"
```

By default, `params_filters` is set to `["password", "secret"]`

###ignore_classes

Sets for which exception classes we should not send exceptions to bugsnag.com.

```ruby
config.ignore_classes << "ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid"
```

You can also provide a lambda function here to ignore by other exception
attributes or by a regex:

```ruby
config.ignore_classes << lambda {|ex| ex.message =~ /timeout/}
```

By default, `ignore_classes` contains the following:

```ruby
[
  "ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound",
  "ActionController::RoutingError",
  "ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken",
  "CGI::Session::CookieStore::TamperedWithCookie",
  "ActionController::UnknownAction",
  "AbstractController::ActionNotFound"
]
```

###ignore_user_agents

Sets an array of Regexps that can be used to ignore exceptions from
certain user agents.

```ruby
config.ignore_user_agents << %r{Chrome}
```

By default, `ignore_user_agents` is empty, so exceptions caused by all
user agents are reported.

###proxy_host

Sets the address of the HTTP proxy that should be used for requests to bugsnag.

```ruby
config.proxy_host = "10.10.10.10"
```

###proxy_port

Sets the port of the HTTP proxy that should be used for requests to bugsnag.

```ruby
config.proxy_port = 1089
```

###proxy_user

Sets the user that should be used to send requests to the HTTP proxy for requests to bugsnag.

```ruby
config.proxy_user = "proxy_user"
```

###proxy_password

Sets the password for the user that should be used to send requests to the HTTP proxy for requests to bugsnag.

```ruby
config.proxy_password = "proxy_secret_password_here"
```

###logger

Sets which logger to use for Bugsnag log messages. In rails apps, this is
automatically set to use `Rails.logger`, otherwise it will be set to
`Logger.new(STDOUT)`.

###middleware

Provides access to the middleware stack, see the
[Bugsnag Middleware](#bugsnag-middleware) section below for details.


Bugsnag Middleware
------------------

The Bugsnag Notifier for Ruby provides its own middleware system, similar to
the one used in Rack applications. Middleware allows you to execute code
before and after an exception is sent to bugsnag.com, so you can do things
such as:

-   Send application-specific information along with exceptions, eg. the name
    of the currently logged in user,
-   Write exception information to your internal logging system.

To make your own middleware, create a class that looks like this:

```ruby
class MyMiddleware
  def initialize(bugsnag)
    @bugsnag = bugsnag
  end

  def call(notification)
    # Your custom "before notify" code

    @bugsnag.call(notification)

    # Your custom "after notify" code
  end
end
```

You can then add your middleware to the middleware stack as follows:

```ruby
Bugsnag.configure do |config|
  config.middleware.use MyMiddleware
end
```

You can also view the order of the currently activated middleware by running `rake bugsnag:middleware`.

Check out Bugsnag's [built in middleware classes](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-ruby/tree/master/lib/bugsnag/middleware)
for some real examples of middleware in action.


Deploy Tracking
---------------

Bugsnag allows you to track deploys of your apps. By sending the
source revision or application version to bugsnag.com when you deploy a new
version of your app, you'll be able to see which deploy each error was
introduced in.

### Using Capistrano

If you use [capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano) to deploy
your apps, you can enable deploy tracking by adding the following line to your
app's `deploy.rb`:

```ruby
require "bugsnag/capistrano"
```

### Using Rake

If you aren't using capistrano, you can run the following rake command from
your deploy scripts.

```shell
rake bugsnag:deploy BUGSNAG_REVISION=source-control-revision BUGSNAG_RELEASE_STAGE=production
```

The bugsnag rake tasks will be automatically available for Rails 3
apps, to make the rake tasks available in other apps, add the following to
your `Rakefile`:

```ruby
require "bugsnag/tasks"
```

### Configuring Deploy Tracking

You can set the following environmental variables to override or specify
additional deploy information:

-   **BUGSNAG_RELEASE_STAGE** -
    The release stage (eg, production, staging) currently being deployed.
    This is set automatically from your Bugsnag settings or rails/rack
    environment.

-   **BUGSNAG_API_KEY** -
    Your Bugsnag API key. This is set automatically from your Bugsnag
    settings in your app.

-   **BUGSNAG_REPOSITORY** -
    The repository from which you are deploying the code. This is set
    automatically if you are using capistrano.

-   **BUGSNAG_BRANCH** -
    The source control branch from which you are deploying the code.
    This is set automatically if you are using capistrano.

-   **BUGSNAG_REVISION** -
    The source control revision for the code you are currently deploying.
    This is set automatically if you are using capistrano.

-   **BUGSNAG_APP_VERSION** -
    The app version of the code you are currently deploying. Only set this
    if you tag your releases with [semantic version numbers](http://semver.org/)
    and deploy infrequently.

For more information, check out the [deploy tracking api](https://bugsnag.com/docs/deploy-tracking-api)
documentation.

### EventMachine Apps

If your app uses [EventMachine](http://rubyeventmachine.com/) you'll need to
manually notify Bugsnag of errors. There are two ways to do this in your
EventMachine apps, first you should implement `EventMachine.error_handler`:

```ruby
EventMachine.error_handler{|e|
  Bugsnag.notify(e)
}
```

If you want more fine-grained error handling, you can use the
[errback](http://eventmachine.rubyforge.org/EventMachine/Deferrable.html#errback-instance_method)
function, for example:

```ruby
EventMachine::run do
  server = EventMachine::start_server('0.0.0.0', PORT, MyServer)
  server.errback {
    EM.defer do
      Bugsnag.notify(RuntimeError.new("Something bad happened"))
    end
  }
end
```

For this to work, include [Deferrable](http://eventmachine.rubyforge.org/EventMachine/Deferrable.html)
in your `MyServer`, then whenever you want to raise an error, call `fail`.
