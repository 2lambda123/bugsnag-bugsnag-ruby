Feature: Rails automatic breadcrumbs

Background:
  Given I set environment variable "BUGSNAG_API_KEY" to "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
  And I set environment variable "APP_PATH" to "/usr/src"

Scenario Outline: Request breadcrumb
  Given I set environment variable "RUBY_VERSION" to "<ruby_version>"
  And I start the service "rails<rails_version>"
  And I wait for the app to respond on port "6128<rails_version>"
  When I navigate to the route "/breadcrumbs/handled" on port "6128<rails_version>"
  Then I should receive a request
  And the request is a valid for the error reporting API
  And the request used the "Ruby Bugsnag Notifier" notifier
  And the request contained the api key "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
  And the event has a "request" breadcrumb named "Controller started processing"
