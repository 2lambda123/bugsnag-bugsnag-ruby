# Bugsnag Rails v3.2 demo

This Rails application demonstrates how to use Bugsnag with Rails v3.2.
Further details about integrating Bugsnag with Rack applications can be found [here.](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/ruby/rails/)

Install dependencies

```shell
bundle install
```

## Configuring Bugsnag and Rails v3.2

There are two methods of configuring Bugsnag within a Rails application:

1. Your `API_KEY` can be exported as an environment variable `BUGSNAG_API_KEY`.

2. Generate a bugsnag configuration file at ```config/initializers/bugsnag.rb``` which can be populated with the [available configuration options](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/ruby/rails/configuration-options/) by running the rails command:
  ```shell
  rails generate bugsnag YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
  ```

This is sufficient to start reporting unhandled exceptions to Bugsnag.

## Running the example

Run the example using:

```shell
bundle exec rails server
```

Once the server is running head to the default path for more information on Bugsnag logging examples.
