<h2>Sidekiq</h2>

<p>This route demonstrates how to use Bugsnag with Sidekiq.</p>

<p>
    While testing the examples open
    <a href="https://app.bugsnag.com">your Bugsnag dashboard</a>
    in order to see the example errors and exceptions being received.
</p>

<p>
    Make sure you have a Redis instance running that your test application can
    connect to before running these examples.

<ol>
    <li>
        <p><a href="/sidekiq/crash">Crash</a></p>

        <p>Raises an error within the framework, generating a report in the Bugsnag dashboard.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p><a href="/sidekiq/notify_data">Notify with data</a></p>

        <p>
            Sends Bugsnag a report on demand using <code>bugsnag.notify</code>
            and attaches additional data within a <code>block</code>. In this case we're
            adding information about the function being called to go into the
            <code class="upper">function</code> tab, and additional diagnostics
            as a <code class="upper">diagnostics</code> tab.
